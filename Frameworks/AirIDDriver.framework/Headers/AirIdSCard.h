 * @function unicept_SCardEstablishContext
 *
 * @abstract
 *     The unicept_SCardEstablishContext function establishes the resource manager context (the scope) within which database
 *     operations are performed.
 *
 * @discussion
 *     This is the first API call neccessary to be able to communicate with the Unicept(R) AirID(R) smart card reader.
 *     The context handle returned by unicept_SCardEstablishContext can be used by database query and management functions.
 *     To release an established resource manager context, use unicept_SCardReleaseContext.
 *
 *     Special note:
 *         the current implementation allows only ONE context to be established at a time.
 *
 * @param dwScope [in]
 *     Scope of the resource manager context. This parameter can be one of the following values:
 *     SCARD_SCOPE_USER   : Database operations are performed within the domain of the user.
 *     SCARD_SCOPE_SYSTEM : Database operations are performed within the domain of the system.
 *                          The calling application must have appropriate access permissions for any database actions.
 * @param pbPowerMan [in]
 *     Reserved for future use and must be NULL.
 *
 * @param pvReserved2 [in]
 *     Reserved for future use and must be NULL.
 *
 * @param phContext [out]
 *     A handle to the established resource manager context.
 *     This handle can then be supplied to other functions attempting to do work within this context.
 *
 * @returns
 *     If the function succeeds, the function returns SCARD_S_SUCCESS.
 *     If the function fails, it returns an error code.

 * @param mszReaders [out]

 *     would have been returned if this parameter had not been NULL to pcchReaders, and returns a success code.
 *     Note: This approche is unsafe, because the actual length of the multi-string might change over time.
 *
 * @param pcchReaders [out]
 *     Length of the mszReaders buffer in characters. This parameter receives the actual length of the
 *     multi-string structure, including all trailing null characters. If the buffer length is specified as
 *     SCARD_AUTOALLOCATE, then mszReaders is converted to a pointer to a byte pointer, and receives the
 *     address of a block of memory containing the multi-string structure. This block of memory must be
 *     deallocated with SCardFreeMemory. Using SCARD_AUTOALLOCATE is the preferred and secure way to go.
 *

 *     The length, in bytes, of the pbSendBuffer parameter.
 *     For T=0, in the special case where no data is sent to the card and no data expected in return, this length
 *     must reflect that the bP3 member is not being sent; the length should be sizeof(CmdBytes) - sizeof(BYTE).
 *
 * @param pioRecvPci [out]
 *     Pointer to the protocol header structure for the instruction, followed by a buffer in which to receive any
 *     returned protocol control information (PCI) specific to the protocol in use. This parameter can be NULL if
 *     no PCI is returned.
 *
 * @param pbRecvBuffer [in]
 *     Pointer to any data returned from the card.
 *     For T=0, the data is immediately followed by the SW1 and SW2 status bytes. If no data is returned from the
 *     card, then this buffer will only contain the SW1 and SW2 status bytes.
 *
 * @param pcbRecvLength [in, out]
 *     Supplies the length, in bytes, of the pbRecvBuffer parameter and receives the actual number of bytes received
 *     from the smart card. This value cannot be SCARD_AUTOALLOCATE because SCardTransmit does not support SCARD_AUTOALLOCATE.
